# Movie Recommendation Website
This is a website that uses Machine Learning to recommend certain movies to a user.

Project is live on http://movierecommend.pythonanywhere.com/

## Working

This model uses both the approaches for recommendations systems that are :
* Collaborative Filtering
* Content based Filtering

This model is trained on 1000 users and 2000 movies. Each user has rated atleast 20 movies from a scale of 1 to 5 and based on this record movies are recommended to the user that may he/she like.
